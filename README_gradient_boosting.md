# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Gradient Boosting
- Introduction:
  - This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
  - The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
  - It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a [PCA transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
  - Feature 'Class' is the target feature variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

# Sentimential Analysis using IMDB Reviews (TFIDF + Gradient Boosting)
- Introduction:
  - IMDB dataset having 50,000 movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
  - The goal is to predict the "sentiment" class which takes value "positive" or "negative".

  - [**Random noise feature test**](https://github.com/houzhj/Machine_Learning/blob/main/ipynb/imdb_random_noise_test.ipynb): evaluate feature selection methods, according to whether they are able to identify random noise feautures.
  - [**Boruta analysis**](https://github.com/houzhj/Machine_Learning/blob/main/ipynb/imdb_boruta_analysis.ipynb): Conducting Burota feature selection using different combinations of algorithms (LGB,XGB, Random forest) and type of feature importance (gain,split,cover,weight,impurity).
