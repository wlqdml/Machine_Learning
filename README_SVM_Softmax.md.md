# SVM and Multinomial (Softmax) Regression Models for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
- Introduction:
  -  The [MNIST](https://academictorrents.com/details/323a0048d87ca79b68f12a6350a57776b6a3b7fb) (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 × 28 pixels.
  -  The goal is to predict the label (0-9) of the digit.
